## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Structure and clean raw sales data for analytical use
- Calculate key business KPIs
- Perform multi-dimensional sales performance analysis
- Build an interactive dashboard for decision-making
- Present insights clearly and logically

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation Steps
- Removed formatting inconsistencies
- Standardized date formats
- Created calculated fields (Revenue, Profit, Delivery Time, Return Flag)
- Normalized promotion labels and product categories

---

## 📊 KPIs Used
| Metric | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Total Revenue** | Total sales value |
| **Total Profit** | Revenue minus product and operational costs |
| **MoM Trend** | Month-over-month performance change |
| **Avg Delivery Time** | Operational efficiency indicator |
| **Return Rate** | Customer satisfaction and quality measure |

## 🔍 Analytical Dimensions
Analysis was conducted across:
- **Salesperson performance** (behavioral and product-mix insights)
- **Product performance** (high vs low margin drivers)
- **Regional performance** (strategy vs demand comparison)
- **Promotion effectiveness** (impact on revenue and margin)

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Dynamic KPI Cards
- MoM Line Chart
- Sales by Region & Product Visualizations
- Salesperson Performance Ranking
- Interactive Slicers (Region, Product, Salesperson, Promotion)

All dashboard elements are designed with **clean color hierarchy** and clear analytical storytelling.

## 🧠 Key Insights (High-Level Summary)
- High-margin products (especially *Laptop* and *Printer*) are primary profit drivers.
- Regional performance differences are driven more by **sales strategy** than geography.
- Sales performance variation depends heavily on **product mix selection** among sales staff.
- MoM trend shows a temporary slowdown period that can be addressed with targeted campaigns.

---

## 🚀 What I Learned
- Structuring Excel workbooks for analysis (not just calculation)
- Designing dashboards with **purposeful visual hierarchy**
- Extracting **insight**, not just reporting numbers
- Communicating data findings clearly and briefly

---

## 🔜 Next Step
This project concludes the **Excel module** of my data analytics learning path.

Next, I am moving on to the **SQL module** — applying the same analytical reasoning to database environments and query-based analysis.
